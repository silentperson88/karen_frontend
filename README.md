# FRONT-END
## Stack
- Next.js
- Sass
## Folder structure
```
\__ public
\__ src
    \__ components
    \__ pages
    \__ styles
        \__ components
        \__ pages
```
The project's current state doesn't include any backend/APIs integration, the folder structure is to be updated when the requirements will include such behaviors.
